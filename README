NAME
    Git::Wrapper::Plus - A Toolkit for working with Git::Wrapper in an OO
    Way.

VERSION
    version 0.001000

DESCRIPTION
    Initially, I started off with "Dist::Zilla::Util::" and friends, but I
    soon discovered so many quirks in "git", especially multi-version
    support, and that such a toolkit would be more useful independent.

    So "Git::Wrapper::Plus" is a collection of tools for using
    "Git::Wrapper", aiming to work on all versions of Git since at least Git
    1.3.

    For instance, you probably don't realise this, but on older "git"'s,

        echo > file
        git add file
        git commit
        echo 2 > file
        git add file
        git commit

    does nothing, because on Git 1.3, "git add" is only for the addition to
    tree, not subsequent updates.

        echo > file
        git add file
        git commit
        echo 2 > file
        git update-index file
        git commit

    Is how it works there.

    And you'd have probably not realised this till you had a few smoke
    reports back with failures on old Gits.

    And there's more common failures, like some commands simply don't exist
    on old gits.

MODULES
  "Git::Wrapper::Plus::Refs"
    "Git::Wrapper::Plus::Refs" is a low level interface to refs.

    Other modules build on specific types of refs, but this one is generic.

  "Git::Wrapper::Plus::Branches"
    "Git::Wrapper::Plus::Branches" is a general purpose interface to
    branches.

    This builds upon "::Refs"

  "Git::Wrapper::Plus::Tags"
    "Git::Wrapper::Plus::Tags" is a general purpose interface to tags.

    This builds upon "::Refs"

COMMON INTERFACE
        use Git::Wrapper::Plus;

        my $plus = Git::Wrapper::Plus->new( '.' );
        $plus->refs     # Git::Wrapper::Plus::Refs
        $plus->branches # Git::Wrapper::Plus::Branches
        $plus->tags     # Git::Wrapper::Plus::Tags
