Git::Wrapper::Plus

Initially, I started off with "Dist::Zilla::Util::" and friends, but I
soon discovered so many quirks in "git", especially multiple-version
support, and that such a toolkit would be more useful independent.

So "Git::Wrapper::Plus" is a collection of tools for using
"Git::Wrapper", aiming to work on all versions of Git since at least Git
1.3.

For instance, you probably don't realize this, but on older "git"'s,

    echo > file
    git add file
    git commit
    echo 2 > file
    git add file
    git commit

does nothing, because on Git 1.3, "git add" is only for the addition to
tree, not subsequent updates.

    echo > file
    git add file
    git commit
    echo 2 > file
    git update-index file
    git commit

Is how it works there.

And you'd have probably not realized this till you had a few smoke
reports back with failures on old Gits.

And there's more common failures, like some commands simply don't exist
on old gits.
