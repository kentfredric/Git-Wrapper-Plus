NAME
    Git::Wrapper::Plus - A Toolkit for working with Git::Wrapper in an
    Object Oriented Way.

VERSION
    version 0.001001

DESCRIPTION
    Initially, I started off with "Dist::Zilla::Util::" and friends, but I
    soon discovered so many quirks in "git", especially multiple-version
    support, and that such a toolkit would be more useful independent.

    So "Git::Wrapper::Plus" is a collection of tools for using
    "Git::Wrapper", aiming to work on all versions of Git since at least Git
    1.3.

    For instance, you probably don't realize this, but on older "git"'s,

        echo > file
        git add file
        git commit
        echo 2 > file
        git add file
        git commit

    does nothing, because on Git 1.3, "git add" is only for the addition to
    tree, not subsequent updates.

        echo > file
        git add file
        git commit
        echo 2 > file
        git update-index file
        git commit

    Is how it works there.

    And you'd have probably not realized this till you had a few smoke
    reports back with failures on old Gits.

    And there's more common failures, like some commands simply don't exist
    on old gits.

MODULES
  "Git::Wrapper::Plus::Refs"
    "Git::Wrapper::Plus::Refs" is a low level interface to refs.

    Other modules build on specific types of refs, but this one is generic.

  "Git::Wrapper::Plus::Branches"
    "Git::Wrapper::Plus::Branches" is a general purpose interface to
    branches.

    This builds upon "::Refs"

  "Git::Wrapper::Plus::Tags"
    "Git::Wrapper::Plus::Tags" is a general purpose interface to tags.

    This builds upon "::Refs"

  "Git::Wrapper::Plus::Versions"
    "Git::Wrapper::Plus::Versions" is a simple interface for comparing git
    versions.

COMMON INTERFACE
    You don't have to use this interface, and its probably more convenient
    to use one of the other classes contained in this distribution.

    However, this top level object is usable if you want an easier way to
    use many of the contained tools without having to pass "Git::Wrapper"
    instances everywhere.

        use Git::Wrapper::Plus;

        my $plus = Git::Wrapper::Plus->new('.');
        $plus->refs        # Git::Wrapper::Plus::Refs
        $plus->branches    # Git::Wrapper::Plus::Branches
        $plus->tags        # Git::Wrapper::Plus::Tags
        $plus->versions    # Git::Wrapper::Plus::Versions

METHODS
  "BUILDARGS"
    Construction takes 4 Forms:

        ->new( $string ) # Shorthand for ->new( { git => Git::Wrapper->new( $string ) } );
        ->new( blessed ) # Shorthand for ->new( { git => blessed } );
        ->new( @list   ) # Shorthand for ->new( { @list } );
        ->new( { key => value } ); # Final form.
