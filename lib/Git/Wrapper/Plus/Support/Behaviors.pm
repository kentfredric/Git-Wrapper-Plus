=head1 SUPPORTED BEHAVIORS

=head2 C<add-updates-index>

Prior to 1.5.0-rc0, git add did not update the index, and was only for the initial addition.

Subsequent adds were done with C<git update-index>

=head2 C<can-checkout-detached>

Prior to 1.5.0-rc1, C<git checkout SHA1> simply failed, instead of giving a detached head.

=head2 C<2-arg-cat-file>

Very early on, C<git cat-file TYPE SHA1> was not supported, but this support was added
between the initial commit, and 0.99
