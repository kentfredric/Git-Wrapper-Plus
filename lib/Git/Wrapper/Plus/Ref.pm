=head1 NAME

Git::Wrapper::Plus::Ref - An Abstract REF node

=head1 VERSION

version 0.004001

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Git::Wrapper::Plus::Ref;

    my $instance = Git::Wrapper::Plus::Ref->new(
        git => $git_wrapper,
        name => "refs/heads/foo"
    );
    $instance->refname # refs/heads/foo
    $instance->name    # refs/heads/foo
    $instance->sha1    # deadbeefbadf00da55c0ffee

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<refname>

Return the fully qualified ref name for this object.

This exists so that L<< C<name>|/name >> can be made specialized in a subclass, for instance, a C<branch>
may have C<name> as C<master>, and C<refname> will be overloaded to return C<refs/heads/master>.

This is then used by the L<< C<sha1>|/sha1 >> method to resolve the C<ref> name to a C<sha1>

=head2 C<sha1>

Return the C<SHA1> resolving for C<refname>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 C<name>

B<REQUIRED>: The user friendly name for this C<ref>

=head2 C<git>

B<REQUIRED>: A C<Git::Wrapper> compatible object for resolving C<sha1> internals.
